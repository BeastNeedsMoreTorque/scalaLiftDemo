Issue: lack of transaction handling (handled by default in Boot.scala).
Outcome: Addressed Dec 11 2015 with DB.use and reading up on Boot.scala which supports transactions for the time of a http request.
Tested with a sleep on Dec 12.

Dec 13: comet implementation actually publishes to all browsers on all hosts, not original intent to have it tied to a user session!

Push geolocation with Ajax to web server to set Session data... Or lazy-load directly with timeout...

rationalize Get template for Store and Product
Forum info has example that works for single object extract at a time, not for a collection on children nodes. Could not make it work, but separated
logic between Product and Store. They relied on Manifest API.

get JS to feed in (via JSON) data server for geolocation

Have default geolocation and specify to user that it is a default due to lack of input

Use version control. Using GIT, now need to backup files as Gitub private is for a fee.
Implemented as of Dec 12. Need backups.

Use more packages, possibly finer grain

Question API usage more frequently (e.g. Props queerness)

sbt: simply use jetty:start (not container:start). Upgrade to latest.

Upgrade scala (2.11.7 is latest as of Fall 2015)

Upgrade liftweb fairly aggressively (2.6 is latest as of Fall 2015), read release notes

Dec 22: bugs
forcing data category (coolers) too large for product.primary_category causes a crash instead of catching exception nicely.

Seeing crappy Unmapped Lift-like parameter seen in request [/]: F1248216611878RCLVMO
when using snippets instead of comet and mixing up login/logout with 2 sessions in the same browser.
1) login on one tab as id1, logout on 2nd tab, login as different user id2 on 2nd tab, come back to 1st tab without logging out (user is new but now buttons trigger these errors).

Consume does not always work after a product selection.
