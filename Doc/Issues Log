Issue: lack of transaction handling (handled by default in Boot.scala).
Outcome: Addressed Dec 11 2015 with DB.use and reading up on Boot.scala which supports transactions for the time of a http request.
Tested with a sleep on Dec 12.

Dec 13: comet implementation actually publishes to all browsers on all hosts, not original intent to have it tied to a user session!
Resolved in the next 2 weeks by getting rid of comets...

Push geolocation with Ajax to web server to set Session data... Or lazy-load directly with timeout...
Done in mid December.

rationalize Get template for Store and Product
Forum info has example that works for single object extract at a time, not for a collection on children nodes. Could not make it work, but separated
logic between Product and Store. They relied on Manifest API.
TRY again given individual queries.

get JS to feed in (via JSON) data server for geolocation
Done mid/late December with a REST service.

Have default geolocation and specify to user that it is a default due to lack of input
Done, Dec 29.

Use version control. Using GIT, now need to backup files as Gitub private is for a fee.
Implemented as of Dec 12. Need backups.

Use more packages, possibly finer grain

Question API usage more frequently (e.g. Props queerness, Squeryl)

sbt: simply use jetty:start (not container:start). Upgrade to latest.

Upgrade scala (2.11.7 is latest as of Fall 2015)

Upgrade liftweb fairly aggressively (2.6 is latest as of Fall 2015), read release notes

Dec 22: bugs
forcing data category (coolers) too large for product.primary_category causes a crash instead of catching exception nicely.
Solved with tryo and 3rd value of Box (Failure) and getting rid of Scala Try (Dec 26).
Later on, used setFilter and crop from liftweb Record.

Seeing crappy Unmapped Lift-like parameter seen in request [/]: F1248216611878RCLVMO
when using snippets instead of comet and mixing up login/logout with 2 sessions in the same browser.
1) login on one tab as id1, logout on 2nd tab, login as different user id2 on 2nd tab, come back to 1st tab without logging out (user is new but now buttons trigger these errors).
*** MULTIPLE logins from same browser is not supported by Scotia Bank.

Consume does not always work after a product selection.

Error on loading cache for category should not fail for full category but only for the product that fails!!!

Should handle well oversized data items when storing to database (just truncate)
Resolved: setFilter and crop

Feb 7: added google maps support with directions, markers, and store selection.

Mar 25: LCBO starts truncating data at more than 50 items per page, definitely at 100.
Apache httpclient commons gives a nicer exception:
2016-03-25 17:48:11,273 [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1] ERROR code.model.Store - Problem loading LCBO stores into cache with message 'Truncated chunk ( expected size: 8192; actual size: 6042)' and exception error 'Full(org.apache.http.TruncatedChunkException: Truncated chunk ( expected size: 8192; actual size: 6042))'
