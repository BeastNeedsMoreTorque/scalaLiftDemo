Outcome: Addressed Dec 11 2015 with DB.use and reading up on Boot.scala which supports transactions for the time of a http request.

rationalize Get template for Store and Product
Forum info has example that works for single object extract at a time, not for a collection on children nodes. Could not make it work, but separated

Implemented as of Dec 12. Need backups.

Use more packages, possibly finer grain

Question API usage more frequently (e.g. Props queerness)
