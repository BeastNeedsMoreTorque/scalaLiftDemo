See https://lcboapi.com/docs/v1 about setting a LCBO token, which is required if used from a public website as queries are limited.

My home private usage qualifies for following:
When LCBO API is accessed from a web server or private script, these keys are not rate-limited, and they do not support CORS or JSONP.

You need a Google MAPS API key as per following: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
Once obtained, use it in webapp/index.html at following replacing GET_A_KEY with your API key.
        <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=GET_A_KEY&callback=storeFinder.initMap"
