Dependencies:
SBT: 0.13.1

Scala: 2.11.7

Install PostgresSQL. I use 9.4.5.0

See https://lcboapi.com/docs/v1 about setting a LCBO token, which is required if used from a public website as queries are limited.

My home private usage qualifies for following:
When LCBO API is accessed from a web server or private script, these keys are not rate-limited, and they do not support CORS or JSONP.

You need a Google MAPS API key as per following (JS API): https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
Once obtained, use it in webapp/index.html at following replacing GET_A_KEY with your API key.
        <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=GET_A_KEY&callback=storeFinder.initMap"

Install initial SQL tables using POSTGRES_SCHEMA_INIT.SQL. What may cause portability issues for other databases in that file are:
Usage of sequences to generate IDs.
Usage of SERIAL in users table for primary key (auto increment in other RDBMSs).
Table "Inventory" is double quoted. It's managed by Squeryl outside of LIFT's Record control and useful to represent stateful many-to-many relations between store and product.

Security:
None. In particular, there is none planned in database and none on web side of things with registration of users not enforcing any password complexity

HA/fail-over: none
